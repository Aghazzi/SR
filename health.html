                        Cancer is a malignant growth or tumor resulting from an uncontrolled division of cells. This can
                        spread
                        affecting other tissues and causing death. However, Lebanon is a middle-income Middle East

                        also
                        plagued with cancer. Actually, several data were analyzed over the 2008-2015 years detecting the
                        cumulative increase in cancer incidence rates. As a result, most of the cancers were suggested
                        to
                        infect
                        the breast, lungs, colorectal, bladder and prostate.

                                Lung cancer was the most common cancer in men worldwide, contributing 15.4% of the total
                                number of new cases diagnosed in 2020. The top three – lung, prostate and colorectal

                        You can reduce your risk of getting cancer by making healthy choices like keeping a
                        healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting the amount of alcohol you drink, and protecting
                        your skin. <br><br>
                        Vaccines (shots) also help lower cancer risk. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine helps
                        prevent most cervical cancers and several other kinds of cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine can
                        help lower liver cancer risk.
                        <br><br>⦁ Getting screening tests regularly may find breast, cervical, and colorectal (colon)
                        cancers early, when treatment is likely to work best. Lung cancer screening is recommended for
                        some people who are at high risk.

                        The goal of cancer treatment is to achieve a cure for your cancer, allowing you to continue a
                        normal life span. It depends on your specific situation (such as the type and stage of your
                        cancer, your general health and your preferences).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgery: Surgery's main objective is to completely remove the malignancy, if
                                possible.
                            </li>
                            <li>Chemotherapy: Drugs are used in chemotherapy to kill cancer cells.
                            </li>
                            <li>Radiation treatment: High-powered energy beams, such X-rays or protons, are used in
                                radiation therapy to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy devices can either be
                                implanted inside or outside of your body (external beam radiation) (brachytherapy).
                            </li>
                            <li>Transplant of bone marrow: The substance inside your bones called bone marrow is where
                                blood cells are created from blood stem cells. Your own bone marrow stem cells or those
                                from a donor can be used in a bone marrow transplant, often known as a stem cell
                                transplant.
                            </li>
                            <li>Immunotherapy: The biological therapy known as immunotherapy makes use of the immune
                                system to treat cancer. Because your immune system does not detect cancer as an outside
                                invader, it can thrive unchecked inside your body. Your immune system can "see" the
                                cancer and fight it with the aid of immunotherapy.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are also other treatments like Cryoablation, Ablation with Radio Frequency,
                                Clinical Trails and Hormone Treatment.
                            </li>
                            <li>Meditation is also an effective type of treatment. It focuses on the psychological
                                side where it can help patients to find peace and believe in curing disease.

                        Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into
                        energy.
                        Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your
                        bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin
                        acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
                        With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When
                        there isn’t enough
                        insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream.
                        Over time, that can cause
                        serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
                        There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while
                        pregnant).
                        The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the
                        bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2
                        diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what
                        those factors may be.

                        Lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of

                        Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose.
                        <br />
                        Treatment of diabetes involves diet and physical activity along with lowering of blood glucose
                        and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels. Tobacco use cessation is
                        also important to avoid complications. <br>

                            <li>Blood glucose control, particularly in type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes

                            the terms "overweight" and "obesity." Overweight and obesity are defined by body mass index
                            (BMI), which ranges from 25 to 30. <br><br> According to the
                            global burden of illness, the problem has reached epidemic levels, with over 4 million
                            people per year dying as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017. <br><br>In every
                            continent,
                            with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, more
                            people are obese than underweight today, which is one side of the double burden of
                            malnutrition. The main source of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between
                            calories burned and calories ingested. Around the world, there
                            have been an increase in the consumption of fattening and sugary foods that are high in
                            energy, as well as an increase in physical inactivity because of the changing modes of
                            transportation, growing urbanization, and the sedentary

                            heed the aforementioned advice by persistently implementing population-based,
                            evidence-based policies that make regular physical activity and healthier eating options
                            readily available, affordable, and easily accessible to everyone, especially the poorest
                            people. An illustration of such a measure is a levy on
                            beverages with added sugar. The food business can significantly contribute to the promotion
                            of a healthy diet by:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    lowering the fat, sugar, and salt content of processed foods.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Ensuring that all consumers have access to affordable, healthy food options.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Restricting the marketing of foods high in sugar, salt, and fats, particularly those
                                    marketed to children and teenagers.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Ensuring the availability of healthy food options and encouraging workplace physical
                                    activity.

                <div>
                    The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To
                    do this you should:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management
                            health professional (such as a dietitian).
                        </li>
                        <li> Join a local weight loss group.
                        </li>
                        <li> Take up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes
                            (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week.
                        </li>
                        <li> Eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat.
                        </li>
                        <li>You may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare
                            professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    If lifestyle changes alone don't help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be
                    recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb
                    during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable
                    for you. In rare cases, weight loss surgery may be recommended.
